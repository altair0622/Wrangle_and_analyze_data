    "1. Two types of assessment can be used:\n",
    "   - Visual assessment: each piece of gathered data is displayed in the Jupyter Notebook for visual assessment purposes. Once displayed, data can additionally be assessed in an external application (e.g. Excel, text editor).\n",
    "   - Programmatic assessment: pandas' functions and/or methods are used to assess the data.\n",

    "- tw_archive: Merge dogs stages \n",

    "- Copies of the original pieces of data were made prior to cleaning.\n",
